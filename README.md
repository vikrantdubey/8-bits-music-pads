# 8-bits-music-pads

So it's my second web project all the way up from my imagination to the code.	

It was actually the 8-bits-music-pads of the famous DJ Artist's and music producers.

# Files and Folder Description

1. So the index.html and main.css are the base file the homepage of the website .
2. The Martin Kit folder contains all the martin garrix files which was represented as the first button of the homepage.
3.Similarly all the folders containing the respective Artists files.
